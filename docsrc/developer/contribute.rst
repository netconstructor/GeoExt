Contributing to GeoExt
======================

Contributing to the GeoExt code base is easy.


Ticket Lifecycle
================

The first way to contribute is to create a ticket in our Ticket Management System.
You can file a bug report, create a feature request, or otherwise let us know that
work needs to be done. 

If filing a bug report, here are some suggestions that will get your bug fixed
faster.

Sandboxes
=========

If you ever want to make modifications to GeoExt but need your own place to play,

will not only give you a place to house your code for other GeoExt member to see,
but it will also allow you to more easily keep up with main line changes to
the GeoExt code base.
