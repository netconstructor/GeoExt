Before deploying GeoExt applications in a production environment, there are several steps you should take to make sure your application can stand up to a high volume of users and provide a nice, fast experience to all of them.  In addition, some features of your application may fail when you change hosts.

* Proxying: Access data from other services
* Minifying: Ensure lightning-fast page loads
* Security: Protect yourself and your users
